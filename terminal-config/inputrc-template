# This inputrc will be linked as /root/.inputrc and used in every terminal launch
# in a devcontainer that uses the ubuntu-devcontainer as a base
# https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/ubuntu-devcontainer

# This file is initialized by the devcontainer, but you are then free to edit it

# Execute default, opinionated settings:
# https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/ubuntu-devcontainer/blob/main/terminal-config/inputrc-default
# delete this line to remove defaults
$include ~/terminal-config/inputrc-default

# add your override settings for every shell below
